    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">Well, when it comes securing a website from web security attacks theres alot of different practices one could use to hinder such things. Like for example, automatic user timouts, which involes hiding or like protecting ones information since theres a lot of people out there who just leave their information sitting in a browser for a long period of time.
        Another thing i would advise the client to use is something we call authentication, which involes adding a authentication/two factor authentication to their website which will thigten their security even more. You can use protocols like OneLogin to achive this, or you could make your own. One last thing i would tell the client, is to learn how to santize data. What sanatizing of data essentialy is, to be sure that the data/information that the system receives is in a format that is correct. This can be achived through programs like NodeJs and ORM.</p>
